about=This plugin brings state-of-the-art AI segmentation to QGIS using Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM). It allows you to segment objects in satellite imagery and rasters with just a click.

    Key Features:
    
    - Package Management: Automatically sets up a dedicated Python environment with all required deep learning libraries (approx. 2 GB).
    - AI Model Management: Installs SAM models and ONNX runtimes optimized for both CPU and GPU.
    - Image Encoding: Efficiently processes raster images into .tiff format for real-time model interaction.
    - Interactive Editor: Point-and-click tool to segment objects instantly on your map.
    - Export Options: Save calculations and export segmentations directly to your layers.
    
    The plugin is actively maintained and will receive updates with new models and features.
