version=1.0.0
author=TerraLab AI

about=AI Segmentation brings the power of Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to QGIS for interactive segmentation of satellite imagery, orthophotos, and other geospatial rasters.

    Features:
    - Interactive point-based segmentation (click to segment)
    - Pre-encoding for real-time performance on CPU
    - Export results as GeoPackage polygons
    - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

    EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES:
    This plugin requires external Python packages (numpy, onnxruntime) that are not bundled with QGIS.
    After first startup, an installation dialog will assist you. Alternatively, install manually:
    
    Windows (OSGeo4W Shell):
        python -m pip install numpy onnxruntime
    
    macOS/Linux (Terminal):
        pip3 install numpy onnxruntime
    
    Then restart QGIS.

    UNINSTALLATION:
    When you uninstall the plugin via QGIS Plugin Manager, dependencies and models
    are automatically removed (they are stored inside the plugin folder).
    
    Cache files for encoded images may remain in:
    - ~/.qgis_ai_segmentation_cache/ (web layers cache)
    - .ai_segmentation_cache/ folders next to your GeoTIFF files
    
    You can safely delete these folders manually if needed.
