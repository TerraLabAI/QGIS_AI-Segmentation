**AI Segmentation** brings state-of-the-art AI segmentation to QGIS using Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM). This plugin empowers GIS professionals to segment objects in satellite imagery, orthophotos, and other raster datasets with unprecedented ease and precision.

## Key Features

*   **Easy Installation**: Automatically handles the setup of a dedicated Python environment with all required deep learning libraries (approx. 2 GB), ensuring a conflict-free experience.
*   **Optimized Performance**: Deploys SAM models and ONNX runtimes optimized for both CPU and GPU execution, giving you the best performance available on your hardware.
*   **Image Encoding**: Efficiently processes and encodes raster images into an optimized format for real-time model interaction.
*   **Interactive Editor**: A user-friendly point-and-click interface allowing for instant object segmentation directly on your map canvas.
*   **Export Options**: Seamlessly save your segmentation results and export them directly to your vector layers.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install the Plugin**: Install via the QGIS Plugin Manager.
2.  **First Run**: Upon first launch, the plugin will guide you through the installation of necessary dependencies and models.
3.  **Select a Raster**: Choose the raster layer you wish to segment.
4.  **Start Segmenting**: Use the interactive tool to click on objects and watch them be segmented instantly!
